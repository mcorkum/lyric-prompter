# 🎵 Lyric Prompter — Raspberry Pi 5

A fullscreen teleprompter for live performance lyrics. Reads `.txt` and `.md` files from a USB stick (or `~/Songs/`) and displays them beautifully in kiosk mode.

---

## Quick Install

```bash
# 1. Copy these files to your Pi, then:
bash install.sh
```

Reboot and Chromium opens automatically in fullscreen kiosk mode.

## Lyric File Format

### Plain Text (`.txt`)
```
[Verse 1]
Your lyrics here
One line per line

[Chorus]
Chorus lyrics
```
Square-bracket labels like `[Verse 1]` are highlighted automatically.

### Markdown (`.md`)
```markdown
# Song Title

## Chorus
Your chorus lyrics

## Verse 1
Your verse here

**Important word** for emphasis
*Softer word* in italics
```

---

## USB Stick Layout

Just copy your lyric files anywhere on a FAT32 USB:

```
USB/
├── 01 - Amazing Grace.txt
├── 02 - Hallelujah.md
├── Originals/
│   └── My Song.txt
└── Covers/
    └── Bohemian Rhapsody.md
```

Songs are sorted alphabetically by filename. Plug in the USB — the song list refreshes automatically within a few seconds. Press `R` to force an immediate refresh.

---

## Manual Start (without rebooting)

```bash
# Start the server manually
python3 ~/lyric-prompter/server.py &

# Open kiosk (Wayland/Bookworm)
chromium-browser --kiosk --ozone-platform=wayland http://localhost:5000

# Open kiosk (X11/Bullseye)
chromium-browser --kiosk http://localhost:5000
```

---

## Auto-scroll Speed

Auto-scroll defaults to 55 px/s. Adjust it **live** with `[` (slower) and `]` (faster) while the prompter is running — no need to edit code. The badge in the corner shows the current speed.

To change the default, edit this line in `templates/index.html`:

```js
let scrollSpeed = 55;   // px/s — increase for faster, decrease for slower
```

---

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Fix |
|-------|-----|
| No songs found | Press `R` to refresh; check USB is mounted under `/media/` |
| Text too small | Press `+` to increase; or edit `--font-size: 2.2rem` in the CSS |
| Cursor visible | `sudo apt install unclutter` and add `@unclutter -idle 0.5 -root` to LXDE autostart |
| Kiosk doesn't launch | Check `systemctl status lyric-prompter` and the autostart file |
| USB not detected | Run `lsblk` — Pi OS mounts USB under `/media/<username>/<label>` |
